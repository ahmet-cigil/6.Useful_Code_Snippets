        "2. Measure and compare their performance.\n",

        "1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation:\n",

        "especially when you are not sure about them (e.g., if you’re not\n",

        "median value, or to just drop the rows).\n",
        "Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore,\n",
        "prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long,\n",
        "you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using\n",
        "Gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek et al.).\n",
        "2. Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often produce\n",
        "better performance than running them individually.\n",

        "performance on the test set to estimate the generalization error.\n",
        "WARNING\n",

        "Also monitor your inputs’ quality (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor\n",
        "sending random values, or another team’s output becoming\n",
        "stale). This is particularly important for online learning\n",
        "systems.\n",
